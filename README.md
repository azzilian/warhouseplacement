**Solution to test task
**
After some research + itense usage of google I come to conclusion it better to implement weighted median method for this task solution

Map Generator - used for creating point via Hashmap as a grid x*y - created just to make sure that solution will work for different input data

FindOptimalPoint - basically solution itself
